## Goals
* Turn this repo into a working website that allows people to view and (possibly) discuss my solution.
* Never change a submitted, working solution. Only provide a new and improved (or at least alternate) solution for a given problem.
* Solve Project Euler problems
* Write tests for each solution
* Write a quick article explaining the code, why I chose to do it this way, what I was thinking and how I might improve upon it.
